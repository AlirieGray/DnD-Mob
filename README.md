## Description
This is the player's companion app to the [DM Tools](https://github.com/fersot100/DM_Tools) desktop application. DM Tools allows a Dungeon Master and a group of players to keep track of the many pieces of information important to an ongoing campaign such as HP, equipment, spells, and XP. The code for the server that connects the desktop and mobile apps can be found [here](https://github.com/fersot100/dnd-serv).
